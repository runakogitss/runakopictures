## Artist Statement

*"Photography is my way of expressing art—freezing emotions, stories, and fleeting moments into something tangible. I thrive in the spontaneity of street photography and the thrill of travel, where every corner holds a new scene, a new feeling to capture. Through my lens, I seek to preserve raw emotions and unspoken narratives, turning ordinary streets and distant landscapes into frames filled with life."*
